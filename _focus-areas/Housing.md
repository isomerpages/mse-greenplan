We have embarked on various initiatives to develop HDB housing estates with eco-friendly and smart features. 

For new developments, these include solar-ready roofs for easier installation of solar panels and rainwater harvesting system to reduce the usage of potable water. 

For existing towns, through the Green Towns Programme, we have introduced initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption, recycling rainwater, and cooling HDB towns.
