**Our Global Commitment to Climate Change and Sustainable Development**

**Supporting the Paris Agreement**

The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the 21st session of the Conferences of the Parties (COP-21) in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit the rise in average global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to pursue efforts to limit this further by 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

Although Singapore contributes only 0.11% of global emissions, we are playing our part as responsible global citizens to mitigate climate change. Singapore ratified the Paris Agreement on 21 September 2016, becoming one of the first few countries to do so. Singapore submitted its enhanced climate pledge, or Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) to the UNFCCC on 31 March 2020. We have committed under our NDC to peak emissions at 65 MtCO2e around 2030. Building on our NDC, our LEDS aspires to halve emissions from its peak to 33 MtCO2e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.

The Green Plan charts concrete sectoral plans and targets over the next ten years, positioning us to achieve our long-term net-zero emissions aspiration as soon as viable, and to build up our climate, resource and economic resilience.

**Supporting the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

Adopted by UN Member States in 2015, the 2030 Agenda comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which serve as a blueprint for sustainable development in all dimensions, i.e., economic, environmental, social. These SDGs were adopted by all countries at the United Nations in 2015 under a framework document called the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda) (2030 Agenda).

Since its adoption, the 2030 Agenda has spurred the people, public and private sectors to work together to achieve the SDGs and to pursue a green and inclusive recovery from COVID-19.

The Green Plan reinforces our commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It specifies targets that will enhance our food security, ensure sustainable water management, scale up deployment of clean energy, promote sustainable economic growth, green our infrastructure and industries, and position our city to be resource-efficient and climate-resilient. Realising these targets will require a whole-of-nation effort, we will work in [partnership](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/take-action/what-you-can-do/) with the community and industries to co-create solutions and further progress in these areas.

Accordingly, these efforts support SDGs **2** (Zero Hunger), **6** (Clean Water and Sanitation), **7** (Affordable and Clean Energy), **8** (Decent Work and Economic Growth), **9** (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), **11** (Sustainable Cities), **12** (Responsible Consumption and Production), **13** (Climate Action), and **17** (Partnership for the Goals).

**Our Global Commitment**

Taken together, the Green Plan demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to climate action and sustainable development, in sync with international efforts and the global sustainability agenda. More information on Singapore’s climate pledges and our progress as tracked by indicators under the SDGs can be found [here](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/press-release/submission-of-singapores-enhanced-nationally-determined-contribution-and-long-term-low-emissions-development-strategy) and [here](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/sdg), respectively.
